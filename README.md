# SimplePHPRouting

This is a template for beginners written in the PHP programming language. <br> 
It is not written object-oriented but procedurally.
<br><br>
An example is given in index.php which can be further developed according to the similar pattern.
<br><br>
Improvements and comments are welcome.
